# Time Series Revenue Forecasting

In this project, I forecast Toronto city future revenue using current revenues, weather conditions, and holidays.

I use RNNs LSTM cells and forecast using minute data per minute data as well as per day.

The model achieves a very good RMSE on the minute data and not so good on the daily data.
